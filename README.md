### Clustering on Crime centers

A study about the relationship of nightclubs to crime in CABA was made. It was found that using a K-means cluster
and two datasets from the open database of the city, one can isolate clusters of crime which happen on the same
blocks as nightclubs. This explains the majority of crimes commited in the relevant time-frame while showing a clear transition
in the distribution of crimes compared to day-time.

### Machine learning on depleting population

In Argentina, since 2016 there has been a fall in the national birth rate. The project investigates
specifically this phenomenon and shows that the drop is seen for every province, and that some cities
lagged behind in this trend before sticking to it. A Random Forest Regressor is trained with all of the
data from the provinces except "Buenos Aires" and then used to predict the birth rate of the province.
